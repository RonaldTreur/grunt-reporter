This plugin requires Grunt `>=0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, you probably shouldn't be here. If -on the other hand- you feel like a Grunt guru, then please continue to install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-reporter --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-reporter');
```
